# default simulation results 
1. IkBa: 
â€” Shape roughly match (three cycle damped oscillation) 

- Late phase level: data > simulation ; data not reach to basal at 24 hours 
**** probably it is due to much higher fold of induction 

- Induction fold is too high compare to the data (exp: 2.5 folds, data: 20 fold) 

2. IkBb
- Shape match (rapidly drop and rise) 

- Simulated result is a little faster than data 
** first 2 hours in simulation but 4 to 6 hour in data) 

3. IkBe 
- shape match (little dip in first hour and induced) 
- 4 to 6 hour recovered in data but 2 hr only in simulation 

4. p100
- dynamics not match 
** data: gradually increase to the platau; sim: 4hr reached a plateau but keeps up again at 16 hour and then decrease) 

- first 2hour match 

- 2 to 4 hour too rapid in simulation 

# compare L929 cell vs 3T3 cells 
1. IkBb basal is 3 fold higher in L, 
2. p100 basal is about 10 fold less in L 
3. p100 m
