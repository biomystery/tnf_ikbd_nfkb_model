# default is really good 

- Only p100 less fold; 

1. increase p100 induced txn 4 fold causes lower later phase fold for other ikb members (exp051916_txnD.png) 

2. or we lower the basal 

- ikbb 2-8 hour no recovery  

1. beta:nfkb half-life longer .12 vs. .18) 







# experimental data
1. IkBa quick response (up and down) 
2. 



# default simulation results 
1. IkBa: 
â€” Shape roughly match (three cycle damped oscillation) 

- Late phase level: data > simulation ; data not reach to basal at 24 hours 
**** probably it is due to much higher fold of induction 

- Induction fold is too high compare to the data (exp: 2.5 folds, data: 20 fold) 

2. IkBb
- Shape match (rapidly drop and rise) 

- Simulated result is a little faster than data 
** first 2 hours in simulation but 4 to 6 hour in data) 

3. IkBe 
- shape match (little dip in first hour and induced) 
- 4 to 6 hour recovered in data but 2 hr only in simulation 

4. p100
- dynamics not match (first 8hr dynamics not match) 
** data: gradually increase to the platau; sim: 4hr reached a plateau but keeps up again at 16 hour and then decrease) 

- first 2hour match 

- 2 to 4 hour too rapid in simulation 

- very weak inducibility (0.025 vs. 8 -ikba; similar to IkBb) 


4a. Understand p100 dynamics(why p100 two steps and dropped down) 
- p100 should not be controlled by canonical IKK and why initially a drop?
- three phases accumulation (fast, slow, fast) > why ???
- last phase 8hr t1/2 decreasing (probably due to protein decay) 


- its dynamics is slow 
*** 6 hour mRNA half-life (beta about 4.5hr, ikbet  3hr, ikbat 20 mins) 
*** 8 hour protein half-life 


- delayed 90 mins in Txn 
** rapidly recovered in first 2hours, (not delayed) 

# compare L929 cell vs 3T3 cells 
1. IkBb basal is 3 fold higher in L, 
2. p100 basal is about 10 fold less in L 





# solving the problem 

1. IkBa induction fold is too high in sim. 
- Txn drop 
*** ok with fold reduced 
*** lost drop at 2hr time point 
*** change fold and platau in IkB epsilon 

- Basal rise 



2. IkB eps late phase drop (>10hr)
- probably ok if clear the loading variation due to the cell death  

# model 

- Werner et al. 2008: 
* IkK not forming complex but by enzymatic reaction
